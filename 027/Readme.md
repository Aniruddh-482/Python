<!--
# Tkinter Layout Managers #
# ----------------------- #

> Pack():  
    pack():  The Pack geometry manager packs widgets in rows or columns.
    Put a widget inside a frame (or any other container widget), and have it fill the entire frame. 
    Place a number of widgets on top of each other. Place a number of widgets side by side.

> Place(): 
    place(): The Place geometry manager is the simplest of the three general geometry managers provided in Tkinter.
    It allows you explicitly set the position and size of a window, either in absolute terms, or relative to another window.
    To put a particular widget to a precise position

> Grid():  
    grid(): The Grid geometry manager puts the widgets in a 2-dimensional table.
    The master widget is split into a number of rows and columns, and each “cell” in the resulting table can hold a widget. 
    The grid manager is the most flexible of the geometry managers in Tkinter.

# WARNING: can't use grid() and pack() both in the same programe.

# Padding: Add space around window or any specific widget so that they are not all crushed together.
