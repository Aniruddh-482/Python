# Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit.

# going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
# What you need to know
# The functions move() and turn_left().
# Either the test front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), right_is_clear() or wall_on_right(), and at_goal().
# How to use a while loop and if/elif/else statements.
# It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (not in Python).
