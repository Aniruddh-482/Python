# List Comprehension 3
# -------------------- #
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD
# Instructions:
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 2
# 3

# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 3
# 4

# result = [2, 3]
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings.

with open("file1.txt") as file:
    file_1_data = file.readlines()

with open("file2.txt") as file:
    file_2_data = file.readlines()

result = [int(num) for num in file_1_data if num in file_2_data]

print(result)

# Output ==>
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
